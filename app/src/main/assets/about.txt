<p>This Social Engineering Protection Training Tool (SEPTT) was developed as part of a Computer Science Honours project at the University of Cape Town. This app was developed as a cyber security educational tool. Social engineering is a growing problem as more people fall victim to social engineering attacks. This tool will assist people in identifying social engineering attacks and, in so doing, prevent people from falling victim to social engineering attacks. This tool aims to make people more aware of social engineering and more alert to detect social engineering attacks in their everyday lives.</p>
