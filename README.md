# Social Engineer

This is the repository for the social engineering detection Android app developed as part of my 2016 Computer Science Honours project. This Android app will use the Social Engineering Attack Detection Model version 2 (SEADMv2) to help the user detect whether they are the victim of a social engineering attack. The SEADMv2 is implemented in an online back-end system and the app makes calls to this web service. This allows for changes to be made to the Social Engineering Attack Detection Model at any time without the need to update the app, since these changes will all be server-side.
